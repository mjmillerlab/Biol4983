## Overview
Zika, Swine Flu, Bird Flu, West Nile, SARS. It seems like we hear about a new infectious disease threatening the world every day. It’s not fake news, or even the ubiquity of cable news. Around the world we face an increasing rate of newly emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. This course will look to understand the drivers of emerging infectious diseases from ecological and evolutionary perspectives. This course is intentionally multi-disciplinary: it’s is equally appropriate for students interested in heath science careers as for students interested in careers in wildlife management and conservation. Because most emerging diseases are tropical in origin, much time will be spent discussing tropical emerging diseases such as Chikungunya, Zika, and Ebola. The core exercise in this course will be careful, and critical reading of the primary, peer-reviewed literature. The first goal for all students is to understand the evolutionary-ecology of disease, but a secondary one is to be able to read and interpret primary literature as scientists do.

## Course Description
This course is a senior seminar course, a requirement for Biology majors that is intended to hone your skills of biological interpretation — including how you can apply biological concepts to local, regional, and global problems — and also to hone your understanding of how scientists perform research.

Disease ecology is a broad field, and there are several approaches to how this material could be taught. Given the capstone seminar nature of our course, I have chosen to focus on emerging zoonotic terrestrial diseases that affect humans. Disease ecology can also be taught in terms of wild and domestic plant diseases, marine diseases, etc. While those topics won’t be our focus in the course, the general ecological and evolutionary principles addressed in this course are applicable to those systems.

## Expectations
(I’ve borrowed heavily from Dr. Dan Allen’s Fall 2016 Seminar Syllabus for these)

This is a seminar course, which means there will be no lectures.  This means that if you miss class, you won’t be able to catch up by looking over powerpoint slides or another student’s notes. So the most important expectation  is to attend class.

Secondly, as a seminar, this course is reading heavy and discussion heavy. Because our discussions will focus on the reading that we do, it is imperative that we all do a careful job with the reading. I have found that weekly reading quizzes ensure that students read carefully, and that as a result our discussions are more enriching. You won’t find the answer to reading quizzes in the papers’ abstracts, but the correct answer will be apparent if you read the paper carefully, taking notes. 

Thirdly, the success of this class is measured largely in the success of the discussions. A large portion of your grade (in fact the largest percentage) will be based on your participation in these discussions, which means several important things:
 
You need to share your ideas and perspectives with the rest of the class. Simply being present, while an important first step, is not by itself an adequate level of participation. Discussions without meaningful contributions will result in poor participation grades.
	
You must respect the ideas and perspectives of other students. We will have an open and welcoming climate for all views, ideas, questions, and perspectives … with the exception of those that are disrespectful towards others. Contributing to the class in manner that is disrespectful to others will count as negative points towards your participation grade. Repeat offenders will be asked to leave the class.
	
You need to have ideas and perspectives to share with the class in the discussions, which means you have to A) perform any assigned readings ahead time, and B) take some time to think to generate ideas and perspectives prior to the discussion taking place.

Lastly, I have expectations for myself in the role of instructor of this class. First, you can expect me to be fair and reasonable. Second, you can expect me to be considerate and respectful. Third, you can expect me to be available outside of class.  This includes being available during office hours, and also by email. I will do my best to respond within 24 to 48 hours during the week (unless I am out of town). On the weekends, I’ll try to answer emails on Sunday nights. Finally, you can expect me to be flexible and responsive to student input.

## Organization of Weekly Seminar
Each week (with the exception of week 1) will have the following format:

1. Reading Quiz 
2. Show and Tell A Pathogen (2 students per week)
3. Break 
4. Topic Overview Presentation 
5. Paper Discussion

### Reading Quizzes
As described above, the reading quiz is designed to demonstrate that you have read that week’s readings with care and attention, and that you are ready to participate in discussion. They will be hand written, short answer.

### Show and Tell A Pathogen
In week 1, each student will be assigned a pathogen (see list below) that you are to present to the class in the form of a show and tell. Typically, this is as a power point or similar presentation. The idea is for you to provide an in depth discussion of the interesting ecological or evolutionary aspects of your pathogen, through an interpretation of the primary literature. I’ve chosen /zoonoses/ (a term you will learn in this class) that have sufficient primary, peer-reviewed literature for you to present the pathogen in an evolutionary or ecological context.  Following standard scientific presentation formats, your presentation should last 12 minutes, and we will provide 5 minutes for questions from the audience. 

Your presentation should begin with an overview of the basic natural history of your pathogen. Where was it first discovered? Has it spread geographically? What is know about vectors and reservoir hosts? What is the scale of human disease? And then it should expand into issues of ecology, especially as these have been presented in primary literature. I recommend using graphs from primary literature (with sources). The best presentations will end with your interpretation of future research directions, and when relevant a discussion of appropriate social policy on combating this pathogen.

There will be two rounds of show and tell a pathogen for each weekly meeting between week 3 and week 13. During week 14, there will be three rounds. I will demonstrate a Show and Tell A Pathogen during week 2.

### Weekly Journal Paper Discussion
Between weeks 2 and 13, we will discuss a series of peer-reviewed scientific articles that center on a major conceptual theme in disease ecology. For each week, I have assigned a series of principle readings. All students are required to read these articles. Two

### Week 12: One Health
### Week 13: The role of ecology/environment in non-infectious disease?


### Week 14: ACAT Testing
This week we will have the final three Show and Tell presentations. After these, the Biology Department will administer it’s ACAT test. ACAT stands for “Area Concentration Achievement Test” and it is a standard sort of achievement test, like you probably recall from high school. The test is not an exit exam and it does not affect your grade in this course, nor your ability to graduate. Rather, it provides the Undergraduate Studies Program with useful information about what subjects students seem to know well and which they seem to need more experience in.

### Week 15: Poster Session 
This week we will display each of your posters in a post session, similar to what you would experience at a research conference. More details to follow.

### Course Policies
#### Attendance and Make-up Assignments:
This course only meets once per week, so attendance is mandatory. 100 points (including the missed reading quiz points) will be deducted from your final grade for each class missed after the first absence (if 3 classes are missed, 200 points will be deducted from your final grade; if one class is missed, no points will be deducted but participation points from that class will be forfeited). If you miss four or more classes, you will receive an “F” as your course grade. 

Likewise, reading quizzes start promptly at 6:30 PM, and last 10 minutes. We cannot postpone discussion to allow you to “have extra time” if you show up late for class. There are no make up opportunities for reading quizzes for which you arrive late.
 
I will make every effort to find a reasonable accommodation for students who miss class (and any associated participation points) as a result of participation in Provost-approved University-sponsored activities (such as scholarly competitions, fine arts performances, intercollegiate athletics competitions, and academic field trips, etc.), religious observances, or legally required activities such as emergency military service and jury duty. Medical emergencies may or may not be accommodated, depending on the nature of the circumstance. Written documentation should be provided to the instructor at least one week prior to the event in order for accommodations to be made.
 
All graded events occur at a specific time. Your presentation occurs on a given week; all posters are shared with the department during the penultimate class session. Therefore, there is no accommodation for late assignments. If you fail to deliver your presentation or poster on the given date, you will receive a 0 for the assignment.

### University Policies 
#### Academic Integrity
Violations of academic integrity are strictly prohibited at the University of Oklahoma. As a member of the OU community it is your responsibility to protect your educational investment by knowing and following the rules. For specific definitions on what constitutes violations of honesty and responsibility in scholarship, review the Student’s Guide to Academic Integrity at http://integrity.ou.edu/students_guide.html.
 
To be successful in this class, all work must be yours and yours alone. You may not receive outside help. During reading quizzes you will never be permitted to use your notes, textbooks, calculators, or any other study aids. Should you see someone else engaging in this behavior, I encourage you to report it to myself or directly to the Office of Academic Integrity Programs. That student is devaluing not only their degree, but yours, too. Note that it is my professional obligation to report academic misconduct, which I will not hesitate to do. Sanctions for academic misconduct can include expulsion from the University and an “F” in this course. 
 
#### Religious Observance
It is the policy of the University to excuse the absences of students that result from religious observances and to reschedule examinations and additional required classwork that may fall on religious holidays, without penalty. (/I don’t believe that any religious holidays fall during our scheduled meeting period, but if your’s does, please contact me immediately./)

#### Reasonable Accommodation Policy
Students requiring academic accommodation should contact the Disability Resource Center for assistance at (405) 325-3852 or TDD: (405) 325-4173. For more information please see the Disability Resource Center website http://www.ou.edu/drc/home.html. Any student in this course who has a disability that may prevent him or her from fully demonstrating his or her abilities should contact me personally as soon as possible so we can discuss accommodations necessary to ensure full participation and facilitate your educational opportunities.
 
#### Title IX Resources and Reporting Requirement
For any concerns regarding gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating / domestic violence, or stalking, the University offers a variety of resources. To learn more or to report an incident, please contact the Sexual Misconduct Office at 405/325-2215 (8 to 5, M-F) or smo@ou.edu. Incidents can also be reported confidentially to OU Advocates at 405/615-0013 (phones are answered 24 hours a day, 7 days a week). Also, please be advised that a professor/GA/TA is required to report instances of sexual harassment, sexual assault, or discrimination to the Sexual Misconduct Office.  Inquiries regarding non-discrimination policies may be directed to: Bobby J. Mason, University Equal Opportunity Officer and Title IX Coordinator at 405/325-3546 or bjm@ou.edu. For more information, visit http://www.ou.edu/eoo.html.
 
#### Adjustments for Pregnancy/Childbirth Related Issues
Should you need modifications or adjustments to your course requirements because of documented pregnancy-related or childbirth-related issues, please contact your professor or the Disability Resource Center at 405/325-3852 as soon as possible. Also, see http://www.ou.edu/eoo/faqs/pregnancy-faqs.html for answers to commonly asked questions.
